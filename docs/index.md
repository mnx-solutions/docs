## MNX.io and Triton
The team at MNX has been a long time user of the SmartOS based hypervisor.  We migrated to the Triton Compute Service in 2019 after the Joyent Compute EOL announcement.

## End User Documentation
Triton Compute Service allows you to securely deploy and operate containers with bare metal speed on the MNX.io container-native public cloud, powered by Triton. Triton also supports high performance hardware virtual machines that can be used to run a broad range of operating systems and applications.

## Performance and scale
Triton delivers bare metal performance with the elasticity of virtual machines. By eliminating layers of virtualization and running containers directly on bare metal, applications enjoy the highest possible performance. And, because you are running on OS virtualized containers, you can easily scale your applications and infrastructure up and down.

## Simple management
Leverage container-native Linux on Triton to extend the benefits of containerization to legacy applications and stateful services.

## Security
Triton provides secure isolation for each container, leveraging Zones, a technology that acts as an additional, "steel-wall" that prevents neighboring tenants from attacking other occupants. Patented resource protections insulate containers from noisy neighbors and insure that each container gets its fair share of I/O.

## Software defined networking
Triton's built-in networking offers each container one or more network interfaces, so each container has a full IP stack and is a full peer on the network, making network management easy.

## Dynamic resource usage
Bare metal servers and VMs are rigid units that don't dynamically scale. Triton infrastructure containers can be dynamically resized, in place - which means zero down-time.
